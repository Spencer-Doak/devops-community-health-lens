# Infrastructure Automation Community Health Monitor

This repository contains what is essentially an experiment concerned with the
health of the communities of various infrastructure automation solutions.

The goal of this project is to guage how effectively code is re-used throughout
the communities of various infrastructure automation solutions.

The underlying premise and motivation for this repository/project is a
hypothesis that healthy communities implement code-reuse at a community-wide
level. This sharing/reuse is facilitated through centralized, publicly
accessible community hubs. (E.g., Ansible Galaxy, Chef Supermarket, Puppet
Forge, and Docker Hub.)

  - In healthy communities, it is expected that individuals will tend to build
    upon and incorporate the work of others, similar to the use of libraries in
    software development.

  - In unhealthy communities, individuals may be less likely to rely upon the
  work of others.

## TODO

  - Build audit script for Chef Supermarket
  - Build audit script for Puppet Forge
